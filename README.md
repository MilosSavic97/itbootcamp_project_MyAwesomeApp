Welcome to my first automation testing project on ItBootcamp!

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project, which is designed to automate
the testing of a web application. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in using 
automation tools to test web applications, and to showcase my ability to design and implement effective 
automated tests.

As a beginner in automation testing, this project represents my initial effort to learn and apply
my knowledge of automation testing concepts and techniques. While the current tests may have limitations
and areas for improvement, they serve as a foundation for future tests that will be more sophisticated
and comprehensive. With more experience and knowledge, I will be able to refine my testing approach and 
produce even more effective and efficient automated tests.

This is one of two beginner projects that I have completed, and I am grateful for the guidance and
support provided by ItBootcamp throughout the process. Their training and mentorship have been instrumental
in helping me to gain the knowledge and confidence to undertake this project. I am thankful for their 
dedication to education and for providing me with the resources necessary to succeed in this field.
